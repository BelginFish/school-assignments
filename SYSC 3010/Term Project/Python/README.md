Controller
==========

Controller Pin Connections
--------------------------

The order of the pin connections are as follows. 

Ground-M1-M2-M3-M4-M5-LED-Power

Note that Ground is on the side with the "1" on the plastic of the controller wire connector.


rPi Input Connections
---------------------

- connect Power to constant high on output port
- connect Ground to constant low on input port
- connect each of the M* or LED pins to desired input port pins

Running Instructions
-----------------------

Once the above set up is complete, proceed with running the Arm's software.

Locate the python module *start_robot.py* and enter the following in the terminal of the Raspberry Pi connected to the arm:

pi@raspberrypi ~ $ sudo python 3 start_robot.py
